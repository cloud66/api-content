## Payload Examples

Each webhook includes a standard structure with event-specific data. For detailed payload examples, see:

- **[Payload Structure](/v3/webhooks/payload-structure)** - Common fields and data format
- **Category-specific pages** - Detailed examples for each event type

## Filtering Events

You can subscribe to specific events using the [Stack Alerts](/v3/endpoints/stack-alerts) or [Application Group Alerts](/v3/endpoints/application-groups) endpoints. Events are organized by entity (Stack, Account, etc.) and can be configured per user or team.

<Callout type="info" title="Event Scoping">
Most events are scoped to specific entities:
- **Stack events**: Scoped to individual stacks
- **Account events**: Scoped to the account level
- **Server/Infrastructure events**: Usually scoped to stacks containing the affected servers
