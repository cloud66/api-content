# Infrastructure Events

Infrastructure events are webhooks triggered by changes to your servers, containers, processes, and other infrastructure components.

## Server Events

### `server.stopped`
Triggered when a server stops responding or goes offline.

**Payload includes:**
- Server information (name, IP, status)
- Stack details the server belongs to

```json
{
  "timestamp": 1640995200,
  "event_type": "server.stopped",
  "uid": "123123123123123123",
  "name": "Meerkat",
  "address": "192.168.1.10",
  "server_type": "Rails Server",
  "server_roles": ["rails", "web"],
  "stack": {
    "uid": "abc123def456",
    "name": "My Application",
    "environment": "production"
  }
}
```

### `server.backon`
Triggered when a previously offline server comes back online.

**Payload structure:** Same as `server.stopped` but indicates the server is now responding.

### `server.ip.change.fail`
Triggered when an IP address change operation fails for a server.

**Payload includes:**
- Server information
- `new_ext_ipv4`: The IP address that failed to be assigned

```json
{
  "timestamp": 1640995200,
  "event_type": "server.ip.change.fail",
  "uid": "123123123123123123",
  "name": "Meerkat",
  "new_ext_ipv4": "111.111.111.111",
  "stack": {
    "uid": "abc123def456",
    "name": "My Application"
  }
}
```

## Container & Process Events

### `container.down`
Triggered when a container stops running or becomes unresponsive.

**Payload includes:**
- Container details (name, image, ports)
- Server information where the container was running

```json
{
  "timestamp": 1640995200,
  "event_type": "container.down",
  "container_id": "abc123def456789...",
  "name": "web.lovable-tame-impala",
  "service_name": "web",
  "image": "nginx",
  "ports": [
    {
      "container": 80,
      "http": 80,
      "https": 443
    }
  ],
  "server": {
    "name": "Meerkat",
    "uid": "123123123123123123"
  }
}
```

### `process.down`
Triggered when a monitored process stops running.

**Payload includes:**
- Process information
- Server details

### `web.process.started`
Triggered when a web process starts successfully.

**Payload includes:**
- Stack UID
- Server UID where the process started

```json
{
  "timestamp": 1640995200,
  "event_type": "web.process.started",
  "stack": "abc123def456",
  "server": "123123123123123123"
}
```

### `web.process.stopped`
Triggered when a web process stops.

**Payload structure:** Same as `web.process.started`

### `web.process.unknown`
Triggered when a web process status cannot be determined.

**Payload structure:** Same as `web.process.started`

## Disk Space Events

### `free.disk.space.alert`
Triggered when disk space falls below the configured threshold.

**Payload includes:**
- Server UID experiencing the disk space issue

```json
{
  "timestamp": 1640995200,
  "event_type": "free.disk.space.alert",
  "server": "123123123123123123"
}
```

### `free.disk.space.normal`
Triggered when disk space returns to normal levels after an alert.

**Payload structure:** Same as `free.disk.space.alert`

## Common Use Cases

### Server Monitoring
- **Alerting**: Send notifications when servers go offline
- **Automated Response**: Trigger server restart or failover procedures
- **Monitoring Integration**: Forward events to monitoring systems

### Container Management
- **Auto-scaling**: Trigger container replacement when containers go down
- **Health Monitoring**: Track container health across your infrastructure
- **Log Aggregation**: Correlate container events with application logs

### Capacity Planning
- **Disk Space Alerts**: Get notified before running out of disk space
- **Resource Monitoring**: Track infrastructure health metrics
- **Preventive Maintenance**: Schedule maintenance based on resource usage

## Event Relationships

Infrastructure events are often related and may occur in sequence:

1. `server.stopped` → Server goes offline
2. `container.down` → Containers on that server stop
3. `web.process.stopped` → Web processes become unavailable
4. `server.backon` → Server comes back online
5. `web.process.started` → Services resume

Understanding these relationships helps with building robust monitoring and response systems.
