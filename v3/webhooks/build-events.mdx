# Build & Service Events

Build and service events are webhooks triggered by build operations, service deployments, and cloud resource management activities.

## Service Build Events

### `service.build.ok`
Triggered when a service build completes successfully.

**Payload includes:**
- Stack information
- Service details (name, image, containers)
- Build outcome status
- Docker image information

```json
{
  "timestamp": 1640995200,
  "event_type": "service.build.ok",
  "uid": "abc123def456",
  "name": "My Application",
  "environment": "production",
  "service": {
    "name": "web",
    "containers": [
      {
        "container_id": "abc123def456789...",
        "name": "web.lovable-tame-impala",
        "service_name": "web",
        "image": "nginx",
        "ports": [
          {
            "container": 80,
            "http": 80,
            "https": 443
          }
        ],
        "private_ip": "25.0.0.125",
        "health_state": "verified"
      }
    ],
    "source_type": "git",
    "git_ref": "master",
    "image_name": "nginx",
    "image_tag": "20240101123045123"
  },
  "build_outcome": "success",
  "image": {
    "uid": "def456ghi789",
    "service_name": "web",
    "image_name": "nginx",
    "image_tag": "20240101123045123",
    "build_result": "success",
    "triggered_by": "user@example.com",
    "triggered_via": "web",
    "created_at": "2024-01-01T12:30:45Z"
  }
}
```

### `service.build.fail`
Triggered when a service build fails.

**Payload includes:**
- Stack information
- Service details
- Build outcome status (failure)
- Build failure details

```json
{
  "timestamp": 1640995200,
  "event_type": "service.build.fail",
  "uid": "abc123def456",
  "name": "My Application",
  "service": {
    "name": "web",
    "image_name": "nginx",
    "source_type": "git",
    "git_ref": "master"
  },
  "build_outcome": "failed"
}
```

## Cloud Resource Events

### `cloud_object.delete.ok`
Triggered when a cloud resource (like load balancer, database, etc.) is successfully deleted.

**Payload includes:**
- Object type and identification
- Stack and account information
- Cloud provider details

```json
{
  "timestamp": 1640995200,
  "event_type": "cloud_object.delete.ok",
  "cloud_object_delete_queue": {
    "id": 42,
    "object_type": "load_balancer",
    "network_object_id": "c66_abc123def456",
    "object_name": "c66_abc123def456",
    "stack_id": 1,
    "stack_name": "Awesome Stack",
    "account_id": 11,
    "account_email": "user@example.com",
    "cloud_symbol": "aws",
    "vendor_id": "c66_abc123def456",
    "status": "deleted",
    "created_at": "2024-01-01T12:30:45Z",
    "updated_at": "2024-01-01T12:35:30Z"
  }
}
```

### `cloud_object.delete.fail`
Triggered when cloud resource deletion fails.

**Payload structure:** Same as `cloud_object.delete.ok` but with status indicating failure and potential error details.

## Common Use Cases

### CI/CD Integration
- **Build Notifications**: Get notified when builds complete or fail
- **Deployment Tracking**: Monitor service deployments across environments
- **Quality Gates**: Trigger additional testing after successful builds

### Resource Management
- **Cost Monitoring**: Track when expensive cloud resources are deleted
- **Cleanup Verification**: Confirm that resources are properly cleaned up
- **Audit Logging**: Maintain records of infrastructure changes

### Monitoring & Alerting
- **Build Failure Alerts**: Immediate notification when builds fail
- **Resource Tracking**: Monitor cloud resource lifecycle
- **Performance Monitoring**: Correlate build events with performance metrics

## Event Sequencing

Build events typically follow this pattern:

1. **Build Triggered** → Build process starts
2. **`service.build.ok`** → Build completes successfully
3. **Service Deployment** → New containers are deployed
4. **Health Checks** → Services are verified as healthy

For resource cleanup:

1. **Resource Deletion Initiated** → Cleanup process starts
2. **`cloud_object.delete.ok`** → Resource successfully removed
3. **Billing Updated** → Cost tracking reflects the change
