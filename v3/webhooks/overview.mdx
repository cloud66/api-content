# Webhooks

Webhooks are HTTP callbacks that Cloud66 sends to your specified endpoints when certain events occur in your infrastructure. They provide a real-time way to receive notifications about important changes to your stacks, servers, deployments, and other resources.

## How Webhooks Work

When a subscribed event occurs (such as a deployment completion or server issue), Cloud66 sends an HTTP POST request to your configured webhook URL with a JSON payload containing details about the event.

### HTTP Delivery Specifications

- **Method**: POST with `application/json` content-type
- **Timeout**: 30 seconds (configurable)
- **SSL**: HTTPS is supported with verification disabled
- **Authentication**: No authentication headers are automatically included - implement endpoint-level authentication as needed
- **Retry Logic**: Failed deliveries are logged but **not retried automatically**

<Callout type="warning" title="No Automatic Retries">
Webhook deliveries that fail are not automatically retried. Ensure your webhook endpoints are highly available and implement proper error handling.
</Callout>

### Payload Structure

All webhook payloads include:

- `timestamp` (integer): Unix timestamp when the event occurred
- `event_type` (string): Event identifier (e.g., "stack.provision.ok", "server.stopped")
- **Event-specific data**: Relevant model data using the same format as the Cloud66 API

## Event Categories

Cloud66 webhooks cover 58 different event types organized into these categories:

- **[Stack Events](/v3/webhooks/stack-events)**: Deployment, provisioning, updates, and configuration changes
- **[Infrastructure Events](/v3/webhooks/infrastructure-events)**: Server status, container monitoring, and system health
- **[Build Events](/v3/webhooks/build-events)**: Service builds and cloud resource operations
- **[Security Events](/v3/webhooks/security-events)**: SSL certificates, authentication, and security monitoring
- **[Database Events](/v3/webhooks/database-events)**: Backup operations and database replication
- **[Account Events](/v3/webhooks/account-events)**: Billing and account status changes
- **[Job Events](/v3/webhooks/job-events)**: Scheduled jobs and autoscaling operations

## Use Cases

Webhooks are commonly used for:

- **CI/CD Integration**: Trigger downstream processes after successful deployments
- **Monitoring & Alerting**: Forward events to monitoring systems like DataDog, New Relic, or PagerDuty
- **Slack/Teams Notifications**: Send formatted notifications to team chat channels
- **Audit Logging**: Record infrastructure changes in external systems
- **Automated Response**: Trigger remediation scripts for infrastructure issues
- **Dashboard Updates**: Keep external dashboards in sync with Cloud66 state

## Getting Started

1. **[Set up webhook subscriptions](/v3/webhooks/setup)** - Configure which events to receive and where to send them
2. **[Review event types](/v3/webhooks/events)** - Browse the complete catalog of available webhook events
3. **[Understand payload structure](/v3/webhooks/payload-structure)** - Learn about the data included in webhook payloads
4. **Test your endpoint** - Use the webhook testing features to validate your integration

<Callout type="info" title="Related API Endpoints">
Webhooks are configured through the [Stack Alerts API](/v3/endpoints/stack-alerts) and [Application Group Alerts API](/v3/endpoints/application-groups). You can also manage webhook subscriptions programmatically using these endpoints.
