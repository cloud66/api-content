# Synchronous vs Asynchronous Requests

The Cloud 66 API uses both synchronous and asynchronous methods. Asynchronous methods are specified in the documentation for the associated calls; all others are generally considered synchronous.

**Synchronous** methods will wait for the server to return a response for the request before it will continue processing. Your application will not perform any additional actions until it receives a response from the server.

**Asynchronous** methods will submit the request to the server, but the application will not wait for a response from the server to continue processing. When the server returns a response, the application can execute a callback function to retrieve the response object, but will continue processing until the response is received.

```ruby
#Asynchronous example
stack_id = 'a6b583684833a2cf4845079c9d9350a8'
response = token.post("#{api_url}/stacks/#{stack_id}/actions.json", {body: {:command => 'clear_caches'}})

#Get the action ID
id = JSON.parse(response.body)['response']['id']
puts "Started action with ID: #{id}"

...

#After some time check status
response = token.get("#{api_url}/stacks/#{stack_id}/actions/#{id}.json")

result = JSON.parse(response.body)['response']

#Check if the request finished successfully
if result['finished_success'] == true
  puts 'Success!'
else
  puts "Failed. Error: #{result['finished_message']}"
end
```
