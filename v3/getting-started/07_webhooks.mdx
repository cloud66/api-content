# Webhooks

Webhooks are HTTP callbacks that Cloud66 sends to your specified endpoints when certain events occur in your infrastructure. They provide a real-time way to receive notifications about important changes to your stacks, servers, deployments, and other resources.

## How Webhooks Work

When a subscribed event occurs (such as a deployment completion or server issue), Cloud66 sends an HTTP POST request to your configured webhook URL with a JSON payload containing details about the event.

### HTTP Delivery Specifications

- **Method**: POST with `application/json` content-type
- **Timeout**: 30 seconds (configurable)
- **SSL**: HTTPS is supported with verification disabled
- **Authentication**: No authentication headers are automatically included - implement endpoint-level authentication as needed
- **Retry Logic**: Failed deliveries are logged but **not retried automatically**

<Callout type="warning" title="No Automatic Retries">
Webhook deliveries that fail are not automatically retried. Ensure your webhook endpoints are highly available and implement proper error handling.
</Callout>

## Setting Up Webhooks

### 1. Create Your Webhook Endpoint

Your webhook endpoint should accept HTTP POST requests with JSON payloads:

```javascript
// Node.js/Express example
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.use(express.json());

app.post('/webhooks/cloud66', (req, res) => {
  const webhook = req.body;
  
  // Validate webhook
  if (!webhook.timestamp || !webhook.event_type) {
    return res.status(400).send('Invalid webhook payload');
  }
  
  // Process webhook based on event type
  switch (webhook.event_type) {
    case 'stack.provision.ok':
      console.log(`Stack ${webhook.name} provisioned successfully`);
      break;
    case 'server.stopped':
      console.log(`Server ${webhook.name} is down - investigate immediately`);
      break;
    default:
      console.log(`Received ${webhook.event_type} event`);
  }
  
  // Respond with 200 to acknowledge receipt
  res.status(200).send('OK');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Webhook server running on port 3000');
});
```

### 2. Configure Webhook Subscriptions

Use the [Stack Alerts API](/v3/endpoints/stack-alerts) to configure webhooks for stack-level events:

```bash
curl -X PUT "https://app.cloud66.com/api/3/stacks/{stack_id}/alerts" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {api_token}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "alerts": {
      "deployment_success": {
        "channels": [
          {
            "type": "webhook",
            "enabled": true,
            "webhook_url": "https://your-domain.com/webhooks/cloud66"
          }
        ],
        "active": true
      },
      "server_down": {
        "channels": [
          {
            "type": "webhook", 
            "enabled": true,
            "webhook_url": "https://your-domain.com/webhooks/cloud66"
          }
        ],
        "active": true
      }
    }
  }'
```

For multiple stacks, use [Application Groups](/v3/endpoints/application-groups):

```bash
curl -X PUT "https://app.cloud66.com/api/3/application_groups/{group_id}/alerts" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {api_token}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "alerts": {
      "deployment_success": {
        "channels": [
          {
            "type": "webhook",
            "enabled": true,
            "webhook_url": "https://your-domain.com/webhooks/deployments"
          }
        ],
        "active": true
      }
    }
  }'
```

## Production Best Practices

### Security & Reliability
```javascript
function verifyWebhook(req) {
  // Verify HTTPS
  if (req.protocol !== 'https') {
    throw new Error('Webhooks must use HTTPS');
  }
  
  // Verify payload structure
  const webhook = req.body;
  if (!webhook.timestamp || !webhook.event_type) {
    throw new Error('Invalid webhook structure');
  }
  
  // Verify webhook age (prevent replay attacks)
  const age = Date.now() - (webhook.timestamp * 1000);
  if (age > 300000) { // 5 minutes
    throw new Error('Webhook too old');
  }
  
  return true;
}
```

### Error Handling
```javascript
app.post('/webhooks/cloud66', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    verifyWebhook(req);
    await processWebhook(req.body);
    res.status(200).send('OK');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Webhook processing error:', error);
    
    // Return appropriate status codes
    if (error.message.includes('Invalid')) {
      res.status(400).send('Bad Request');
    } else {
      res.status(500).send('Internal Server Error');
    }
  }
});
```

## Testing Webhooks

Before configuring webhooks, verify your endpoint is accessible:

```bash
# Test your webhook endpoint
curl -X POST "https://your-domain.com/webhooks/cloud66" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "timestamp": 1640995200,
    "event_type": "test.webhook",
    "message": "Test webhook payload"
  }'
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Webhook not received**
   - Verify endpoint URL is accessible from internet
   - Check firewall settings
   - Ensure endpoint responds within 30 seconds

2. **Invalid payload errors**
   - Verify Content-Type is application/json
   - Check JSON parsing in your endpoint
   - Validate required fields (timestamp, event_type)

3. **Duplicate webhooks**
   - Implement idempotency using timestamp + event_type
   - Store processed webhook IDs to avoid duplicates

<Callout type="info" title="Related API Endpoints">
Webhooks are configured through the [Stack Alerts API](/v3/endpoints/stack-alerts) and [Application Group Alerts API](/v3/endpoints/application-groups). You can also manage webhook subscriptions programmatically using these endpoints.
