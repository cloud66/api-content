Generates a one-time password (OTP) for client authentication.

This endpoint creates a temporary authentication token that can be used by Cloud 66 clients for secure API access. The OTP has a limited lifespan and is intended for single-use authentication scenarios.

The generated OTP can be used by Cloud 66 command-line tools and other clients to authenticate with the API without requiring the user to enter their credentials repeatedly.
