# SSL Certificate

Represents an SSL/TLS certificate used for securing web traffic in Cloud66 stacks. Certificates can be either manually uploaded or automatically provisioned through Let's Encrypt integration.

<Model>
<ModelProperty name="uuid" type="string">
Unique identifier for the SSL certificate.
</ModelProperty>

<ModelProperty name="name" type="string">
Certificate display name, typically the primary domain name.
</ModelProperty>

<ModelProperty name="server_group_id" type="integer">
ID of the server group this certificate is associated with.
</ModelProperty>

<ModelProperty name="server_names" type="string">
Comma-separated list of domain names covered by this certificate.
</ModelProperty>

<ModelProperty name="sha256_fingerprint" type="string">
SHA256 fingerprint of the certificate for verification purposes. May be null if certificate parsing failed.
</ModelProperty>

<ModelProperty name="ca_name" type="string">
Certificate Authority name (e.g., "Let's Encrypt") or null for manually uploaded certificates.
</ModelProperty>

<ModelProperty name="type" type="string">
Certificate type: "lets_encrypt" for automatically provisioned certificates or "manual" for externally obtained certificates.
</ModelProperty>

<ModelProperty name="wildcard" type="boolean">
Whether this is a wildcard certificate (covers *.domain.com patterns).
</ModelProperty>

<ModelProperty name="dns_provider_uuid" type="string">
UUID of the DNS provider used for Let's Encrypt domain validation. Only applicable for Let's Encrypt certificates.
</ModelProperty>

<ModelProperty name="ssl_termination" type="string">
SSL termination configuration setting.
</ModelProperty>

<ModelProperty name="has_intermediate_cert" type="boolean">
Whether an intermediate certificate is present in the certificate chain.
</ModelProperty>

<ModelProperty name="status" type="string">
Current certificate status (e.g., "active", "expired", "pending").
</ModelProperty>

<ModelProperty name="created_at" type="string">
ISO 8601 formatted timestamp when the certificate was created.
</ModelProperty>

<ModelProperty name="updated_at" type="string">
ISO 8601 formatted timestamp when the certificate was last updated.
</ModelProperty>

<ModelProperty name="expires_at" type="string">
ISO 8601 formatted timestamp when the certificate expires. May be null if expiration cannot be determined.
</ModelProperty>

<ModelProperty name="certificate" type="null">
Always null in API responses for security reasons. Used only for certificate upload operations.
</ModelProperty>

<ModelProperty name="key" type="null">
Always null in API responses for security reasons. Used only for certificate upload operations.
</ModelProperty>

<ModelProperty name="intermediate_certificate" type="null">
Always null in API responses for security reasons. Used only for certificate upload operations.
</ModelProperty>

## Certificate Types

### Let's Encrypt Certificates
- **Automatic provisioning** - Certificates are automatically obtained and renewed
- **DNS validation** - Uses configured DNS providers for domain validation
- **Free certificates** - No cost for basic SSL certificates
- **Wildcard support** - Can provision wildcard certificates with DNS validation

### Manual Certificates
- **External certificates** - Certificates obtained from any Certificate Authority
- **Upload required** - Certificate, private key, and intermediate certificates must be uploaded
- **Custom CA support** - Supports certificates from any trusted Certificate Authority
- **Extended validation** - Can use EV and OV certificates

## Security Considerations

<Callout type="warning" title="Certificate Data Security">
Certificate private keys and certificate content are never exposed through the API for security reasons. The `certificate`, `key`, and `intermediate_certificate` fields are always null in API responses.
</Callout>

## Use Cases

- **Web application security** - Securing HTTP traffic with SSL/TLS
- **API endpoint protection** - Securing REST API endpoints
- **Custom domain certificates** - Certificates for custom domains
- **Wildcard domain coverage** - Single certificate for multiple subdomains
