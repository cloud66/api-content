Represents an automated workflow configuration that defines custom deployment processes and CI/CD pipelines. Workflows allow for complex, multi-step automation beyond the default Cloud66 deployment process.

<Model>
<ModelProperty name="uid" type="string">
Unique identifier for the workflow (UUID format).
</ModelProperty>

<ModelProperty name="name" type="string">
Human-readable name of the workflow.
</ModelProperty>

<ModelProperty name="default" type="boolean">
Indicates whether this is the default workflow for the associated formation or stack.
</ModelProperty>

<ModelProperty name="tags" type="array">
Array of tag strings associated with this workflow for organization and filtering.
</ModelProperty>

<ModelProperty name="body" type="string">
Workflow definition body containing the actual workflow YAML configuration (only included when full_content=true).
</ModelProperty>

<ModelProperty name="created_at_iso" type="string">
ISO 8601 formatted timestamp indicating when the workflow was created.
</ModelProperty>

<ModelProperty name="updated_at_iso" type="string">
ISO 8601 formatted timestamp indicating when the workflow was last updated.
</ModelProperty>
</Model>

## Workflow Configuration

The `body` field contains YAML configuration that defines:
- **Steps** - Individual tasks and commands to execute
- **Dependencies** - Step execution order and prerequisites
- **Conditions** - When and how steps should execute
- **Environment** - Variables and settings for execution
- **Notifications** - Alert configurations for workflow events

## Default Workflows

When `default` is `true`, this workflow serves as the primary automation process for deployments. Non-default workflows can be triggered manually or by specific conditions.

## Workflow Execution

Workflows are executed as part of:
- **Deployment Pipelines** - Automated deployment processes
- **Manual Triggers** - On-demand workflow execution
- **Event-Based Triggers** - Triggered by specific stack or formation events
- **Scheduled Runs** - Time-based workflow execution

## Use Cases

- **Custom Deployment Steps** - Beyond standard Cloud66 deployment process
- **Integration Testing** - Automated testing during deployments
- **Database Migrations** - Coordinated database updates
- **External Service Integration** - Calling external APIs or services
- **Multi-Environment Promotion** - Coordinating deployments across environments
