title: Cloud 66 Client Libraries
---

Cloud 66 provides client libraries to help you integrate with our API more easily. Currently, we maintain an official SDK for Go, with community contributions welcome for other languages.

## Official SDK

### Go

We provide an official Go client library that offers a complete interface to the Cloud 66 API:

- **Repository**: [cloud66-oss/cloud66](https://github.com/cloud66-oss/cloud66)
- **Features**: Full API coverage, multiple authentication methods, and comprehensive Cloud 66 platform support
- **Installation**: `go get github.com/cloud66-oss/cloud66`

The SDK supports multiple authentication methods:
- Cloud 66 Toolbelt token (stored in `~/.cloud66/cx.json`)
- Personal Access Token from your Cloud 66 account
- Custom token file location

```go
import "github.com/cloud66-oss/cloud66"

// Get client (uses default Toolbelt token)
client := cloud66.GetClient("", "", "")

// List your stacks
stacks, err := client.StackList()
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}

// Work with your stacks
for _, stack := range stacks {
    fmt.Printf("Stack: %s (%s)\n", stack.Name, stack.Environment)
}
```

## Community Libraries

While we don't maintain official SDKs for other languages, the Cloud 66 API is a standard REST API that can be consumed by any HTTP client. Many community members have created unofficial libraries for various languages.

## Building Your Own Client

If no SDK exists for your preferred language, you can easily build one using our comprehensive API documentation. Our REST API supports:

- **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 and API tokens
- **Standard HTTP methods**: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
- **JSON responses**: Consistent data format across all endpoints
- **Error handling**: Standard HTTP status codes with detailed error messages

### Getting Started

1. Choose your preferred HTTP client library
2. Implement authentication (see our [Authentication guide](/v3/getting-started/authentication))
3. Start with basic operations like listing stacks
4. Refer to our API reference for endpoint details

We welcome contributions of community SDKs and are happy to link to well-maintained libraries in other languages.
