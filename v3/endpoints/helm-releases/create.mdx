Creates a new Helm release with the specified chart and configuration.

This operation is performed asynchronously and returns an async action object to track progress. The Helm repository must already be added to your account before creating releases.

<Callout type="info" title="Repository Required">
The Helm repository must be added to your account through the UI before you can create releases from it. The repository URL must match exactly.
</Callout>

<RelatedModels models={['HelmRelease', 'Formation', 'Stack', 'AsyncAction']} />

The async action can be monitored using the [Get Async Action](/v3/endpoints/async-actions/show) endpoint to track the creation progress.
