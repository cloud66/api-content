Generates a one-time password (OTP) for client authentication.

This endpoint creates a temporary authentication token that can be used by Cloud 66 clients for secure web access, exclusively for the calling user. The OTP has a limited lifespan and is intended for single-use authentication scenarios.

The generated OTP can be used by Cloud 66 command-line tools and other clients to authenticate with the web dashboard.
