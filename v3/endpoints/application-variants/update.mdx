Manages rollout variants by committing changes or adjusting canary percentages.

Only applies to rollout variants (blue-green or canary deployments). Use this endpoint to either finalize a rollout by committing it as the new active version, or to adjust the traffic percentage for canary deployments.

<RelatedModels models={['Application Variant', 'Stack']} />

**Operations:**
- **commit**: Finalize the rollout variant (make it the active version)
- **percentage**: Update canary traffic percentage (canary deployments only)

**Examples:**
- Commit a blue-green deployment: `PUT /stacks/:stack_id/application_variants/:id?operation=commit`
- Update canary percentage: `PUT /stacks/:stack_id/application_variants/:id?operation=percentage&canary_percentage=50`
