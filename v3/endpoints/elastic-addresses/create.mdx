Creates a new elastic address (failover group) that provides high availability by allowing traffic to be switched between primary and secondary stacks.

Both stacks must support failover groups and you must have appropriate permissions on both stacks. The stacks cannot be the same and must have DNS configurations.

<Callout type="info" title="Stack Requirements">
Stacks must not be cluster or prepress type and must have head DNS present to be used in failover groups.
</Callout>

**Validation Rules:**
- Primary and secondary stacks must be different
- You must have failover group edit permissions on both stacks
- Stacks must support failover group functionality
- Stacks cannot be cluster or prepress type
