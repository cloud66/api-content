Returns all elastic addresses (failover groups) that belong to the authenticated user's account.

Elastic addresses provide high availability by allowing traffic to be switched between primary and secondary stacks during failures or maintenance operations. They are also known as failover groups.

<RelatedModels models={['ElasticAddress', 'Stack']} />

**Key Features:**
- **High Availability**: Automatic traffic switching during failures
- **Maintenance Windows**: Manual switching for zero-downtime updates
- **Multi-Cloud Support**: Works across different cloud providers
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Status tracking for primary and secondary stacks
