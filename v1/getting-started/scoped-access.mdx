# Scoped Access

A user's scope defines the limits of the actions the user can perform with the Cloud 66 API. The user's scope is encrypted as part of the OAuth access token. Users cannot submit requests not allowed by their defined scopes.

For the web flow, requested scopes be displayed to the user on the authorize form.

| Scope      | Description                                                                                |

| `public`   | Users with this scope have public read-only access and can view limited stack information. |
