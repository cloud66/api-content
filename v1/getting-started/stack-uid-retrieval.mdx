# Stack UID Retrieval

Many requests in the Cloud 66 API rely on the Stack UID value, an alphanumeric string that uniquely identifies your stack. You can retrieve this value by accessing the _Stack information_ page from the right sidebar of your stack page or by submitting an API request to list all stacks. The Stack UID appears in the response body for each stack you maintain.
